Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques:
Introduction
This repository contains code for predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. Rainfall prediction is a critical task with applications in agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. The provided code demonstrates data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation for rainfall prediction.

Dataset:
The dataset used for analysis is stored in a CSV file named 'weatherAUS.csv'. It includes various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall observations from different locations across Australia.

Code Structure:
rainfall_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: Markdown file providing an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and explanations of key concepts.
